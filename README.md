__SEE__ is stands for Sex Education for Eudaemonism. Eudaemonism means a state of being full of happiness. SEE rethinks our society's bad justification about sex education becomes a fun one. SEE gives sex education awareness for the user without giving any out of context judgment, so the user does not need to be worried about being judged, just full of happiness of being awared.

SEE utilizes Kata.ai's technology such as Kata Flow and Kata NL under Kata Platform 3.0. Kata Flow allows SEE to do the conversation automation while Kata NL does text analysis and content classification.
